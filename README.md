# test-assignment-qumaron-v2

This repository contains solutions for the Qumaron test assignment.

Description:
The game starts with an isometric grid of size N x N. On this grid is one object measuring 2x2 tiles, surrounded by a road along which a worker cyclically moves.

The interface includes 3 buttons:
1. Build a 2x2 tile building – After constructing a new building, +1 worker starts walking along the road.
2. Build a 3x2 tile building.
3. Build a 1x1 tile road. Workers can only move on tiles with roads. Workers cannot pass through buildings. The road should automatically connect.
4. Implement a pathfinding algorithm for workers.
5. Reset – Deletes all objects built by the player.

For ground and road tiles, use the provided assets.

A mechanical example of the gameplay can be seen in the game:
